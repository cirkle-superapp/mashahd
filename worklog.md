# Project Worklog — YouTube-like Website

Project root: `/home/z/my-project`
Goal: Build a YouTube-like video sharing website using Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Prisma + SQLite.

## Architecture decisions
- Single user-visible route `/` (per project rules). Navigation between Home / Watch / Channel / Search / Trending / Subscriptions / History / Liked is done client-side via a Zustand store, synced to URL query params (`?v=watch&id=...` etc.) so browser back/forward still works.
- All data lives in SQLite via Prisma. Models: `Channel`, `Video`, `Comment`, `Category`.
- API routes under `src/app/api/...` are the only data source for the client.
- Real video thumbnails fetched via `z-ai image-search` (OSS-hosted, embeddable URLs). Channel avatars via DiceBear HTTP API (deterministic, no fetch needed). Channel banners via CSS gradients. Video playback via Google's public sample MP4s.
- Theme: dark mode default (YouTube-like), with next-themes toggle. Red accent color (`oklch` red) instead of default neutral — feels like YouTube without being indigo/blue.

Task ID: 1
Agent: main
Task: Initialize worklog, plan architecture, set up todos.

Work Log:
- Inspected existing project (Next.js 16, shadcn/ui installed, Prisma configured for SQLite).
- Decided on SPA-on-`/` architecture with Zustand view switching.
- Decided on data model and API surface.
- Created this worklog and a 14-item todo list.

Stage Summary:
- Architecture finalized. Ready to start parallel image fetching + schema work.

Task ID: 2-15
Agent: main
Task: Build the full YouTube-like website end-to-end and verify it.

Work Log:
- Fetched 59 real video thumbnails across 10 categories via z-ai image-search (OSS-hosted, embeddable URLs).
- Defined Prisma schema (Channel, Video, Comment, UserState) and pushed to SQLite.
- Wrote seed data (10 channels, 29 videos, ~87 comments) with real thumbnails, DiceBear channel avatars, gradient banners, and Google sample MP4s for playback.
- Built 8 API routes: /api/videos (list+filter+sort), /api/videos/[id] (with like/subscribe flags), /api/videos/[id]/views, /api/videos/[id]/like, /api/videos/[id]/comments (GET+POST), /api/channels/[id], /api/channels/[id]/subscribe, /api/seed, /api/user-state (anonymous per-browser state via localStorage browserId).
- Built Zustand store for SPA view navigation with URL sync (?v=watch&id=..., ?v=channel&id=..., ?v=search&q=..., ?v=trending|subscriptions|history|liked|library) and a syncFromUrl() method so browser back/forward works correctly.
- Built all UI components: Header (logo, search w/ autocomplete suggestions, theme toggle, mobile hamburger→Sheet), Sidebar (Home/Trending/Subscriptions/Library/History/Liked + Explore + Settings sections), CategoryChips (21 categories, horizontally scrollable), VideoCard + VideoCardHorizontal, HomeView (responsive grid 1→6 cols), WatchView (HTML5 player, like/dislike/share, subscribe, expandable description, comments with sort+post, related-up-next sidebar), ChannelView (gradient banner, avatar, subscribe, Home/Videos/Popular tabs), SearchView, TrendingView (ranked cards), SubscriptionsView (fan-out fetch across subscribed channels), HistoryView, LikedView, LibraryView, Footer (sticky via mt-auto on flex-col main).
- Fixed popstate bug (navigate was pushing a new history entry on back, breaking back/forward — split into navigate() for forward + syncFromUrl() for back/forward).
- Fixed sticky footer (made <main> a flex-col so Footer's mt-auto sticks it to viewport bottom on short pages and pushes down naturally on long pages — verified with JS eval: footerBottom=900 on Library, footerBottom=1658 on Home).
- Added custom slim scrollbars + line-clamp utilities to globals.css.
- Ran lint (clean) and verified end-to-end with Agent Browser + VLM:
  * Home renders header/sidebar/chips/video grid ✓
  * Click video → watch page with player, title, channel, subscribe, like, comments, related ✓
  * Like button updates count ✓
  * Comment posting works (4→5 comments, text appears in DOM) ✓
  * Channel page renders banner, tabs, subscribe ✓
  * Subscribe toggles state + toast ✓
  * Search returns correct results ✓
  * Liked/Subscriptions/History views reflect interactions (browserId persistence) ✓
  * Browser back/forward navigation works ✓
  * Mobile responsive: hamburger opens sidebar Sheet, desktop-only buttons hidden ✓
  * Sticky footer verified on short (Library) and long (Home) pages ✓
  * VLM confirms both home and watch pages are polished YouTube replicas with no visual bugs ✓

Stage Summary:
- Complete YouTube-like website is live at http://localhost:3000/ (preview via the Preview Panel).
- 10 demo channels, 29 videos, 87 comments seeded. Real thumbnails from z-ai image-search, real video playback via Google sample MP4s.
- All core YouTube flows work: browse, search, watch, like, comment, subscribe, history, trending, channels.
- Dark mode by default with light/dark toggle. Fully responsive (mobile hamburger + sheet, desktop sidebar).
- Anonymous per-browser state (likes/subs/history) persisted via localStorage browserId — no auth required.
- Single user-visible route `/` per project rules; all "pages" are client-side views synced to URL query params.

Task ID: 16-25 (Mashahe rebrand + CIRKLE feature import)
Agent: main
Task: Rename ZTube -> Mashahe, adopt CIRKLE's animated circle logo + brand palette, and import features from CIRKLE not yet implemented.

Work Log:
- Explored CIRKLE: fetched https://cirkleapp.vercel.app/ via z-ai page_reader; cloned github.com/fortleem/CIRKLE (token used ephemerally, then scrubbed from git remote). Read brand components (circle-mark.tsx, circle-logo.tsx, circle-avatar.tsx) and overlay components (command-palette, ai-recap, smart-chapters, circle-pulse) + PRODUCTION_AUDIT_REPORT.md.
- Identified CIRKLE brand identity: animated CircleMark = three interlocking circles forming a triangle, rotating 30s linear infinite, gold→rose→teal gradient. Palette: sand-gold #E5C98A→#C2A060→#9A7A3E, deep teal #1A4A5A, cream #FDFCF9. "Mashahd" (مشهد) is CIRKLE's video pillar — "Mashahe" (مشاهِد) is the perfect name for a video app spun out of it.
- Feature gap analysis (CIRKLE has, Mashahe lacks): animated circle logo, Command Palette (⌘K), Smart Chapters, AI Recap, Circle verified avatar, Circle Pulse (live viewers), Live Translate, Mood filter.
- Plan: implement all 8 above + rename + brand palette.

Stage Summary:
- Exploration complete. Beginning implementation.
